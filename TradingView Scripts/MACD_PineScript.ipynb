        "This script is a trading algorithm that enters long and short positions based on a set of conditions. It uses technical analysis indicators and strategies, such as moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger bands, relative strength index (RSI), and moving average, to identify potential trading opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "It calculates the MACD and its signal line, as well as the upper and lower Bollinger bands.\n",
        "It checks for a consolidation period and a breakout in the price.\n",
        "It calculates the value-at-risk (VaR) for the current trade and the RSI value.\n",
        "If certain conditions are met, it enters a long or short position, using a stop-loss and a take-profit order to limit risk and maximize potential profit.\n",
        "For example, the script will enter a long position if there is an upward breakout in the price, the MACD is positive, the RSI is below 70, and the price is above the moving average. It will enter a short position if there is a downward breakout, the MACD is negative, the RSI is above 30, and the price is below the moving average."
